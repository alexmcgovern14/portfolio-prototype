# Portfolio Website – Figma Make Prototype

This repository contains the **original Figma Make–generated code** for my portfolio website.

It represents the **prototype and exploration phase** of the project: translating high-fidelity Figma designs into a working interactive site to validate structure, layout, and narrative before committing to a production codebase.

This repo is intentionally preserved for context and transparency.  
It is **not** the production version of the site.

## Context

- Designs were created in Figma
- Code was generated and iterated on using Figma Make
- The output prioritised speed of iteration over long-term maintainability
- The code reflects the constraints and patterns of a design-to-code tool

The site was later **refactored into a production-quality React application** with a clean architecture, typed data layer, performance optimisations, and accessibility improvements.

That production codebase lives in a separate repository.

## What this repo is (and isn’t)

**This repo is:**
- A snapshot of the design → prototype phase
- Useful for understanding the evolution of the project
- An example of rapid prototyping with Figma Make

**This repo is not:**
- A reference for production React patterns
- Actively maintained
- Deployed to production

## Original Design
